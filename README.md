Encoding and Decoding

The substitution cipher is a cipher that has been in use for many hundreds of years. It basically consists of substituting every plaintext character for a different ciphertext character. The cipher alphabet may be shifted or reversed or scrambled. In this project, we will **combine** two types of substitution cyphers: a simple substitution cipher followed by an affine cipher.
 
**Simple substitution cipher**: the cipher alphabet is created by first writing out a keyword, removing repeated letters in it, then writing all the remaining letters in the alphabet in the usual order. Consider the following example. Consider the alphabet being a single string consisting of the lower-case English letters as below (shown with each letter’s associated index, e.g. m’s index is 12):
